# Garage app

Garage is a simple CRUD application to manage vehicle repairs business. The app allows user to:

- add a vehicle to an array list
- read all vehicles
- update details of a vehicle
- delete a vehicle from an array list
- delete all vehicles from an array list

The app was developed to consolidate my learnings of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and JUnit5 testing.
